# Contributing to moodle-tiny_widgethub

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **moodle-tiny_widgethub** plugin! Your contributions help improve the plugin and expand the variety of widgets available for the Moodle community.

Please review this guide carefully before submitting pull requests or issues.

## üß© Contributing to Widgets

To contribute widgets:

Each contributor will host their own widgets in a public repository. This gives you full control over your widgets, including how and when you update them.

Your repository will include an index.yml file listing the widgets you want to share with the community, each pointing to the downloadable URL of its corresponding widget.yml definition. The contributor will simply inform me of the URL of their index.yml file. Below is an example of the content of such a file.
```
- name: Bootstrap alert boxes
  url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmulet/moodle-tiny_widgethub/main/repository/bs-alert.yml
- name: Bootstrap badges
  url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmulet/moodle-tiny_widgethub/main/repository/bs-badge.yml
```
** Make sure that all URL provide access to downloadable raw files.**

This setup is more dynamic than incorporating widgets directly into the main repository, as it avoids the need to create a new release every time a widget is added or updated.
